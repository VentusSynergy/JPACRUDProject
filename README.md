## JPA CRUD Project

### Week 9 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview

##### In this weeks work, we have been practicing more with integrating SQL to work with Java and be viewed on a webpage. I created data in a database and connected with an entity in Java which I then put together methods to pull that data out and deploy it on a webpage. This webpage allows users to keep track of pets entered into a system and keeps track on an animals well being. This would more likely be used by a veterinarian clinic to keep track of the pets they are taking care of. From where this project is now, it can scale into a bigger website and could be made to be more useful in the future.

### Steps Of The Application

##### Beginning off, I created  starter information in a database on five animals and annotated whether they were sick or healthy. Once created, I moved on to building the JPA project that would be able to store the entity that resided in the database. Once the code was tested and the program was successfully talking to the database, I opened up a Spring MVC project that contained the DAO and controllers and this project acted as the webpage for the site. The webpage allows users to show all pets, search for pets by species, add a new pet, or delete a pet.

### Lessons Learned

##### Using technologies such as Spring and JPA has greatly improved efficiency when creating projects such as this. There is now less code and more readability which will help others, including myself, read the program and make changes when needed.
